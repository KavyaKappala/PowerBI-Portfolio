PowerBI- Metrics By Region Report

This Power BI report provides a comprehensive overview of how key metrics are distributed across various regions(Central, East, South, West). Key features of the report include:

Dynamic Metric Selection: A parameter-driven setup enables users to switch between different metrics—Sales, Profit, and Quantity—dynamically. The visuals update automatically based on the selected metric.

Year-Based Filtering: A slicer allows users to filter data by year, which updates the visuals to reflect both current and previous year values for easier trend comparison.

Region-Wise Matrix: A matrix visual displays both current year and previous year values of the metrics across all regions. This visual remains unaffected by slicer or filter selections, ensuring consistent comparison across time.
